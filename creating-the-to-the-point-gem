How to make a custom Gemini Gem:
1) Define Your Goal

Decide what your objective is. Do you want a brainstorming buddy or a planning partner? I personally wanted to change the output tone and elaboration that Gemini responses give by default.

2) Describe the Respondent Persona

Describe your ideal respondent. Should they have certain degrees or levels of expertise in different fields? My goal was to create a general-purpose tool, so I described someone with multiple Ph.D.s and an IQ of 270.

3) Outline the Instructions and Tone

Remember, a Custom Gemini is a tool that you will reuse for different purposes, so the instructions should be applicable in a variety of circumstances. My core instructions were to be concise and to the point, and specifically not to be agreeable.

4) Save and Use!

After setting the initial persona and instructions, save your Custom Gemini and begin using it immediately.
